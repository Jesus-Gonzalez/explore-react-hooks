# Explore React Hooks

## Description

We're exploring the latest React hooks, in order to understand and learn about how to implement any for whatever use case we find them suitable.

We'll try to cover advanced topics on React hooks, including optimization, memoization, etc.

## Repository

I've split every feature on branches.

You will find every feature in incrementing chapter branches, using the following format:  
feature/[n]/[description] - where `n` is the chapter and `description` the use case to cover.

eg: feature/1/useState, feature/2/useMemo,
## Technologies

I've used nextjs to implement the functionality for ease of use.

Using the latest reactjs build.
